Currently, the DSR is _registered_ with godaddy and _hosted_ by dreamhost.

Here are some key settings:
ssh:
owenmartin:Ih8ska@dailyshitreport.com

web server points to:
/home/owenmartin/dailyshitreport.com/www

mysql server:
host: dsr.drunkwithfriends.com
username: owenmartin
password: Ih8ska

The challenge:

Set up a git repo in the directory with the DSR, probably the www directory. Set up another one (this is already done) on my local machine.

Then, add the repo on the dailyshitreport.com host as a _remote_ to the one on the local machine.

This would allow the command 'git push [some stuff]' to update the website from my local computer.




still hard\n
